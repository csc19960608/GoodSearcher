Suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm. You turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman, wonderful in diamonds and Russian sables. She thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll, flashes out a tiny pair of scissors, snips off the second button of your overcoat, meaningly ejaculates the one word, \"parallelogram!\" and swiftly flies down a cross street, looking back fearfully over her shoulder.\" (opening paragraph of the 4th story in this collection, \"The Green Door\")this collection of o. henry stories was a delight to read! i'm always interested to find out what the twist ending of each story will be. it never turns out how i had imagined! my favorites were \"the cop and the anthem\", \"the last leaf\", and \"the ransom of red chief\". i'm very happy to have impulse-bought this book."}, {"userName": "Haley", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/846874-haley", "userReview": "During the reading this week, I felt that I was really able to see O. Henry\u2019s personality in the stories. One of my favorite parts was the beginning of \u201cSpringtime a la Carte\u201d on page 10:\u201cIt was a day in March.Never, never begin a story this way when you write one. No opening could possibly be worse. It is unimaginative, flat, dry and likely to consist of mere wind. But in this instance it is allowable. For the following paragraph, which should have inaugurated the narrative, is too wildly extravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without preparation.\u201dAnd then he started the story. I almost laughed!!! He totally broke the boundaries that few authors even bend. He was \u201cbreaking the 4th wall\u201d (as some may call it) and I loved it. (He did it again on page 12.) His style was different and exciting. His stories were very comical to me, which seems to be what everyone else thinks. Every now and then, he would have a very random sentence like:\u201cHe had a telephone in his cow house, and he could figure up exactly what effect next year\u2019s Canada wheat crop would have on potatoes planted in the dark of the moon.\u201d (\u201cSpringtime a la Carte\u201d)That seemed pretty random (and hilarious) to me. Here\u2019s another one:\u201cShe got out \u2018The Cloister and the Hearth,\u2019 the best non-selling book of the month\u2026\u201d (\u201cSpringtime a la Carte.\u201d If you can\u2019t tell, that story was one of my favorites!  )It\u2019s no wonder that everyone else seems to like his the best so far. Plus, each of the stories seemed to end with irony. Hawthorne\u2019s style was more formal and eloquent than the others and Poe\u2019s seemed more expressive and thrilling. Then you\u2019ve got O. Henry. He was very conversational in his writing as if saying, \u201cHere\u2019s a story I once heard\u2026\u201d For some reason, I really like that style a lot. However, after a while, it was really simple to see his style and therefore predict the ending. For many of the stories, I felt that they needed a bigger and more exciting (and almost mysterious) ending since they all seemed to have a puzzle-like storyline. For example, I loved the Green Door because of the mysterious feel throughout it. However, the ending was quite disappointing for me. I was really hoping for an amazing (and, for some reason, strange) ending to flow with the enigma theme. However with his ending it was not as exciting anymore and the thrill was gone. Some of them were predictable like \u201cAfter Twenty Years\u201d and \u201cThe Pimienta Pancakes\u201d (which I thought was a strange story). Overall I really liked them, though!!"}, {"userName": "Jason Daly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35678475-jason-daly", "userReview": "The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories is a compelling book consisting of ten short stories that all come together to symbolize life and all the wonders that come with it. Although the stories all have different plots and settings, the characters are all relatable and despite unique events portrayed in each story, it almost seems as if all the stories somehow connect to each other. Among these short stories are tales of a poor couple that will do anything to purchase elegant gifts fr their significant other, a man\u2019s quest to save the love of his life from the sickness that is infecting his town, a girl whom is trapped away in a castle and her story of escape, and a woman looking for her long lost love. These stories, and the many more found within the book, are what makes this book something truly unique and a book that is well worth reading.

I had heard the gift of the magi before, and I remember the first time I heard it I was frustrated because neither one really got a useful gift. Then I read it the second time and I realized the moral behind the story, and how it is showing true love for a person, not just gift giving. It made me ponder on what I have always viewed Christmas time as, and if I pay attention to the people I love enough to know what would be a special gift for them. This book is a great reminder to think about others and remember what the true meaning of love and friendships are."}, {"userName": "Hillary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35027575-hillary", "userReview": "I have grown up with the story of the gift of the Magi.

It was special for me to read the original version and see how much detail goes into this sweet story. I think that all of these short stories are great to have around the home at any age.

It still makes me tear up. The Cop and the Anthem - I had not read this story before. It was a cute story about perseverance. Springtime a la Carte - another story I had not read before. What an enjoyable little love story. The Green Door - all about what we expect to see and a little bit of fate After Twenty Years -- an interesting reunion story. Funny where life takes you.The Furnished Room - a little sad. Almost a ghost story, but not quite. The Pimienta Pancakes -- a tricked suitor, not my favorite story. The Last Leaf -- SOOO good, and so sad, but sweet. I absolutely love this story!!!The Voice of the City -- eh. I didn't particularly like this story. It rambled a bit.While the Auto Waits -- another tale of found love...maybeA Retrieved Reformation -- nothing the love of a good woman can't overcome. Cute story about a second chanceA Municipal Report -- a long story, but it ends well. While the language used to describe the black man is despicable in today's world, the treatment of the man is better than I have read in modern tales. Royalty indeed.A Newspaper Story -- a very short story about the power of the press, even when it doesn't tryThe Ransom of Red Chief -- I remember seeing the televised version of this story. Cute tale about a not-so-cute kidA Ghost of a Chance -- a cute little story about taking chancesMakes the Whole World Kin -- another cute story about how we are all really the same"}, {"userName": "Nely", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1440151-nely", "userReview": "This book is my first introduction to O.Henry and his mischievous twists of fate to all his story endings. I was forewarned about these twists and tried to guess throughout all the stories - but I was always surprised. I found this quite delightful.

The other stories weren\u2019t to my taste but still interesting enough to read.

Some are love stories and some aren't; some have happy endings and some don't; O. Henry does not limit himself to one type of story and the scope of his imagination ranges from the comfortingly traditional to the wildly obscure.  One of my favorites was one told from the point of view of a dog, who kept swearing by Sirius.  While some are as short as three pages long Henry somehow manages to pack in rich character development, place description, and plot, overcoming the apparent limitations of a short story and trumping the efforts of meandering novelists who take a much longer road to get to a watered-down point.  I was introduced to O. Henry's work in my 8th grade English class when we read the Gift of the Magi, which for some reason seems to be his most popular story, but not the one I would consider the best.  I definitely intend on making a project of reading the rest of his works in the future."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading some of the lesser-known ironic stories of O. Henry in this book. My very favorite lesser-known story in this book is \"The Green Door\" in which a man receives a mysterious business card which simply says \"The Green Door\". The man is intrigued because he finds that everyone else has been handed a business card for a dentist office rather than for \"the green door\". So, of course, he has to go in search of this mysterious green door. I love the course of the story. I don't understand why this one isn't as famous as others like \"Gifts of the Magi\" and \"The Ransom of Red Chief\" because it certainly ranks up there.Other stories I enjoyed from the book:*\"Springtime \u00e1 la Carte\" - an accidental second-chance at romance*\"After 20 Years\" - what happens when old friends plan to meet each other at a certain spot in 20 years*\"While the Auto Waits\" - is romance possible between the very rich and the very poor?*\"Makes the Whole World Kin\" - a thief bonds with his victimI have to say, though, that some of the language and cultural references in some of the stories didn't hold up to time and left me a bit confused. And there were some stories here that just weren't interesting.

Henry wrote this book.  It is ten short stories that were published under the pseudonym O. Henry.  His real name was William Sydney Porter.  I've never read his work before or heard of him, so when I came across this book in my 17 year old son's bookcase, I thought why not.  I really enjoyed O. Henry's writing and would had given it 3-1/2 stars instead of 3 if Goodreads gave out 1/2 stars.  I love how each story has a twist and turn.  I also love reading in this time period and how much it's different today.  O. Henry's most famous story is \"The Gift of Magi\", but I found the ending too sad, though I loved the couple's happiness and felt in through his words.

For nearly a century, the work of O. Henry has delighted readers with its humor, irony and colorful, real-life settings. The writer's own life had more than a touch of color and irony. Born William Sidney Porter in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1862, he worked on a Texas ranch, then as a bank teller in Austin, then as a reporter for the Houston \"Post.\" Adversity struck, however, when he was indicted for embezzlement of bank funds. Porter fled to New Orleans, then to Honduras before he was tried, convicted and imprisoned for the crime in 1898. In prison he began writing stories of Central America and the American Southwest that soon became popular with magazine readers. After his release Porter moved to New York City, where he continued writing stories under the pen name O.HenryThough his work earned him an avid readership, O. Henry died in poverty and oblivion scarcely eight years after his arrival in New York.
